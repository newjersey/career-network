          Developing new connections and deepening your existing relationships are KEY to your job
          search.

        <Typography variant="body1">
          Not only are you more likely to find out about new opportunities, people, and companies
          when you broaden your network, many organizations are explicitly looking for you to bring
          new connections to their business needs.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          Although it’s something many job seekers hate, relationship building and meeting new
          people are the two things you need to be spending the most time on in your job search.

            <strong>Relationship-Building Goals in Job Search</strong> – People you don’t know well.
            Research shows that new connections are the ones most likely to bring you new
            opportunities.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Deepen your existing connections</strong> – Make efforts to do things for people
            in your existing network that bring value to them. Sharing resources, offering to
            connect them to someone in your network, and helping them accomplish a goal can help you
            build positive relationships with the people you know.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>
              Work on interesting projects so you have something to talk about besides looking for
              work!
            </strong>{' '}
            – Research trends in your industry or occupation, write white papers or mini reports,
            take on a leadership role in a volunteer organization, or start a mastermind group. Set
            aside time to work on things that you find interesting and that will give you something
            to talk about when you engage with both new acquaintances as well as people in your
            current network.

        <StaticList title="Relationship Basics">
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Don’t move too fast!</strong> – One of the biggest mistakes job seekers make is
            trying to move too quickly in the relationship. People have to know, like and trust you
            before they are going to be willing to give you referrals or leads, so pay attention to
            growing a genuine relationship before you start asking them for leads.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Focus on what you can GIVE, not on what you can GET.</strong> – Look for ways to
            help other people, including sharing resources, information, and connections. When you
            meet new people, think about contributions you can make to their lives or well being. Do
            the same with people you already know. Not only does this improve your relationships, it
            also makes you feel better.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Ask questions that convey interest in the other person.</strong> – When you’re
            job searching, you can become so focused on your job search that you are either selling
            yourself or only asking questions that are related to your needs. But relationships are
            two-way. You need to remind yourself to ask questions that convey your interest in the
            person you are talking to, learning about what they are doing or what’s important to
            them, etc. This helps you identify ways that you can help them, which creates a more
            positive relationship.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Try to meet people through avenues you care about.</strong> – participate in
            meetings or groups where you can meet other people who share those interests.{' '}
            <a href="meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> is a great way to find other people who share your
            interests. Join professional groups on LinkedIn, contribute to conversations, and reach
            out to members in the group who seem interesting or with whom you could share a resource
            or idea that could help them.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Set goals to meet new people each week.</strong> – Challenge yourself to meet 5
            new people a week, or even 10! That’s only one or two new people a day, five days a
            week. Having a specific numeric goal to accomplish will make it more likely that you do
            it.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>
              Set weekly goals to reach out to people who are already in your network.
            </strong>{' '}
            – Try starting your day by sending an email to someone you know, thanking them for some
            way they have contributed to your life. Or spend an hour every Friday afternoon, sending
            check-in emails or making catch-up calls with people you haven’t talked to for awhile.
            Or spend some time writing unsolicited recommendations for people you are connected to
            on LinkedIn.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>
              When you meet new people, connect with them on LinkedIn by sending a personalized
              invitation.{' '}
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/46662/personalizing-invitations-to-connect?lang=en">
                (here’s how)
              </a>
            </strong>
            – Be sure to include something you appreciate about your interaction with them or
            something you have in common that you noticed on their profile.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Don’t just network with other unemployed people.</strong> – Many unemployed job
            seekers have a tendency to connect with other people who are also unemployed. While this
            can be great for support, it isn’t always good for your search. Find ways to meet and
            connect with people who are currently working, even if it feels uncomfortable.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Age-diversify your network.</strong> – Older job seekers in particular tend to
            have networks that skew older. But it’s people in their 30’s and 40’s who may be in the
            hiring manager position. Make a specific effort to reach out to people who are younger
            than you as they may be in the best position to help.
