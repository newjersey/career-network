            <strong>Make a list of target companies</strong> – be strategic about the companies and
            the job opportunities you want to pursue. There are several ways you can begin to
            develop a list of companies you want to target in your job search, including using job
            postings, looking up companies on LinkedIn, and through conversations with people in
            your network. Every time you hear of a new company that might hire people with your
            background and experience, you should add them to your list so that you can do some
            further research.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Find information on those target companies</strong> – do your research. Start
            with the company website. You can also look up the company on LinkedIn and do a Google
            search to discover more information. As you gather information about your target
            companies, keep notes on what you discover, especially as the information may apply to
            how you can bring value to the company. Also pay attention to whether the company is
            aligned with your personal values, passions, etc.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Find job listings at those target companies that are suitable for you</strong> –
            look for opportunities at your target companies that would fit your background and
            skills.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Identify contacts at those target companies</strong> – targeted job search and
            targeted networking is critical to job search. As you are researching companies that
            interest you, you also want to begin developing a list of contacts within those
            companies. Ideally, these are people you already know. But you will also want to
            identify hiring managers, other people in departments you might work with, etc. LinkedIn
            is a great resource to find connections. For each target company you’ve identified,
            continue to compile a list of contacts within that company.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>
              Reach out to those contacts and start to build relationships or work on existing
              relationships
            </strong>{' '}
            – expand your connections or deepen existing ones at the target companies you want to
            pursue. Keep track of the connections, the contact you have made with these connections,
            and be sure to always follow up.
          </React.Fragment>
          <React.Fragment>
            <strong>Create a targeted job search plan</strong> – your plan should consist of
            specific job opportunities at specific companies and specific connections you can turn
            to to help get your foot in the door.
